        <h1>What is Web Development?</h1>
        <p>
            Web development is like building and designing the amazing websites and web apps you use every day. It's the process of creating the interactive and visually appealing online spaces that allow you to browse information, play games, connect with friends, and do so much more. Web developers use programming languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to bring websites to life. They work behind the scenes to make sure everything looks good, works smoothly, and is easy to navigate. Web development is like constructing a virtual world where you can explore, learn, and have fun on the internet.
